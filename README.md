# Getting-started-with-Tensorflow-2
"Getting started with Tensorflow 2" is an online course offered by Imperial College of London on Coursera. I am uploading all the graded weekly assignments along with solutions for reference. 

I thought this might help as the number of students active on Discussion forums are very low. Plus there are are no mentors to sort out problems related to notebooks.

As for the course it is really good and is largely application based rather than theoretical, hence, it is hightly recommended. 

Hope my contribution helps!
