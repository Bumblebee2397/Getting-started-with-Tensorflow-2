# Getting-started-with-Tensorflow-2
"Getting started with Tensorflow 2" is an online course offered by Imperial College of London on Coursera. I am uploading all the graded weekly assignments along with solutions for reference. As their are no mentors and the the number of students active on Discussion Forums are relatively low for this course when compared to other courses/specializations like Deep Learning Specialization and Tensorflow in Practice (both offered by deeplearning.ai), this might help people who are stuck with a particular issue. This course is really good as it is largely application based rather than theoretical, hence, it is hightly recommended. Hope my contribution helps!
